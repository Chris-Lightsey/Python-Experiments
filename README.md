# Python-Experiments for DSCI 8133
This repository contains the initial Github related code that I created for DSCI 8133, *Foundations of Data Science* at Mississippi State University

## Plan
Future plans for this repository include adding a sample data file and a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook that will interact with the file.
